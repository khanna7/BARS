## Compiling BARS Repast code

* Pull the development branch of the BARS repo into your midway account.

* Create a Release directory under the transmission_model directory (i.e. BARS/transmission_model/Release)

* Copy the transmission model from my Release directory to your Release directory. The transmission model is:

     `/home/ntcollie/src/BARS/transmission_model/Release/transmission_model-0.0`

* The following modules need to be loaded in order for it to work

   `module load mvapich2/2.0` 
   `module load R`  
   `module load netcdf/4.2`  
   `module load gcc/4.8`

* I had to install some R packages (ergm etc.) but I imagine you’ve got those already installed. I did have to export R_LIBS though:

   `export R_LIBS=/home/ntcollie/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-library/3.2`

* Run the model from within the Release directory with 

   `./transmission_model-0.0 ../config/config.props ../config/model.props`
