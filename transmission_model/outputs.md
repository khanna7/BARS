# Model Outputs

The location of the model output (csv files etc.) is determined by the *output.directory* property in the model properties file. The individual output described below will be written into this directory using the file names specifed for each file. For example,

```
output.directory = /home/nick/Documents/BARS/output
partnership.events.file = partnership_events.csv
```
will write the partnership event output data (see below) to a /home/nick/Documents/BARS/output/partnership_events.csv file.

If the model input parameters include a *run* parameter then the run number will be appended to the *output.directory*. For example,

```
run = 1
output.directory = /home/nick/Documents/BARS/output
partnership.events.file = partnership_events.csv
```
will write the partnership event output data to a /home/nick/Documents/BARS/output_1/partnership_events.csv file. The expectation is that the mechanism that performs the model parameter exploration will pass a *run* parameter that identifies each model run and that the output of that run will be written into the appropriately named output directory.

Note that where the output is written to a file, the model will not overwrite an existing file. It will create a new output file name by appending a number to the file in order to create a file that does not already exist. For example, if counts.csv, counts_1.csv, and counts_2.csv exist, and output is to be written to counts.csv, then the new output will be written to counts_3.csv.

### parameters.txt
Parameters.txt contains the parameter values for a model run. It is written out immediately after all the [model inputs](inputs.md) have been loaded. 

### Per timestep aggregate data
The aggregate data consist of various aggregate per time step stats (e.g. the total number of persons infected during a timestep). These are recorded in the file defined by *per.tick.counts.output.file* in the model properties file. The format is csv with each row recording the stats for that timestep. The columns are:
* tick: the timestep at which the stats were generated
* entries: the number of persons who entered the simulation at that timestep
* max_age_exits: the number of persons who exited the model due to age (person's age > max age) at that timestep
* infection_deaths: the number of persons who died from infection at that timestep
* asm_deaths: the number of persons who died due to ASM at that timestep
* infected_via_transmission: the total number of persons infected via transmission at that timestep
* infected_via_transmission_N: the total number of persons of age N infected via transmission at that timestep. N is currently
18 - 34 with one column for each age.
* infected_externally: the number of persons infected via external infection at that timestep
* infected_external_N: the total number of persons of age N infected externally at that timestep. N is currently
18 - 34 with one column for each age.
* infected_at_entry: the number of persons who were infected when entering the model at that timestep.
* infected_at_entry_N: the total number of persons of age N infected when entering the model at that timestep. N is currently
18 - 34 with one column for each age.
* uninfected: the number of uninfected persons at that timestep. This includes uninfected entering persons and uninfected persons who have died during this timestep
* uninfected_N: the number of uninfected persons of age N at that timestep. N is currently 18 - 34 with one column for each age.
* steady_edge_count: the number of edges in the steady partner network in the model at the end of the timestep
* casual_edge_count: the number of edges in the casual partner
network in the model at the end of the timestep

* vertex_count_N:  the total number of vertices of age N at the end of the timestep.  N is currently 18 - 34 with one column for each age.
* overlaps: the number of edges that occur in both the main network and the casual network. This is determined by iterating through the edges in the network with the smallest edge count, and incrementing the count if the same edge exists in the other network. Edges are non-directed so the count is incremented if v1 -> v2 or v2 -> v1 exists. The iteration is a relatively expensive operation and it can be turned off by setting the model property *count.overlaps* to false.

### Biomarker logging
Some number of persons can be selected at the start of the model for biomarker logging. Biomarker logging logs the viral load, cd4 count and art status of each selected person at each time step. The data is recorded in the file defined by the *biomarker.log.file* property in the model.props file. The number of persons to log is defined by the *biomarker.persons.to.log* property. The persons to log are either selected randomly from all persons prior to simulation start or person ids can be specified in comma delimited list. To enable random selection, the *biomarker.persons.to.log* should be set to `random:N`
where N is the number of persons to log. To enable the selection of particular persons by id, the *biomarker.persons.to.log* should be set to a comma delimited list of person ids.
The format is csv with each row logging the data for a particular person. The columns in the output are:
* tick: the time step at which the logging occurred
* p_id: the id of the logged person
* viral_load: the viral load the logged person at time 'tick'
* cd4_cout: the cd4_count of the logged person at time 'tick'
* art_stats: the ART status of the logged person at time 'tick'

### Death Events
Death events are recorded each time a person dies. The event is recorded in the file defined by the *death.events.file* property in the model properties file. The format is csv with each row recording an event. The columns are:
* tick: the time step at which the death occurred
* p_id: the id of the dead person
* age: the age of the dead person
* art_status: the ART status of the dead person
* cause: the cause of death. This is one of:
  * AGE
  * INFECTION
  
### R Network
The network can be saved as a R network image at some specified times. The file into which the network is saved is defined in the *net.save.file* property in the model properties. The file will have the timestep at which the network was saved appended to it. The time steps at which to the save file are defined in the *save.network.at* property. The format for the *save.network.at* property is a comma delimited list of numeric timesteps. Note that 'end' can be used as a timestep value to save the network at the end of the simulation. For example,
```
net.save.file = ./output/network.RDS
save.network.at = 4, end
```
will save the network at timestep 4 and at the end of the simulation, resulting in two files: network_4.RDS and network_N.RDS where N is the last timestep of the simulation. The R function 'saveRDS' is used to save the network. It can be loaded into any variable with 'readRDS'. For example,
```
my.net <- readRDS('../transmission_model/Debug/output/network_4.RDS')
```

### Person Data
Person data recording collects the following attributes for each person in the model. The file in which the data is saved is defined by the *person.data.file* model property. The format is csv with one row per person.
* id: the id of the person
* time of entry: the timestamp at which the person entred the model. This is 0 for persons entering during intitialization.
* time of death: the timestamp at which the person died. If the person has not died by the end of the simulation this will be -1.
* infection status: the infection status of the person at death or simulation end.
  * 0: uninfected
  * 1: infected
* time of infection: the timestamp at which the person was infected. If never infected, then -1.
* art status: The ART status of the person at death or simulation end.
  * 0: not on ART
  * 1: on ART
* time of art initiation: the timestamp when the person last went on ART. If never on ART then -1. All the ART events, not just the final one, can be seen in the ART events file.
* time of art cessation: the timestamp when the person last went off of ART. If never went off of ART then -1. All the ART events, not just the final one, can be seen in the ART events file.
* prep status: The PrEP status of the person at death or simulation end
  * 0: not on PrEP
  * 1: not on PrEP after being on PrEP and then diagnosed as positive
  * 2: on PrEP

* time since last test: the time since the person was last tested. If never tested, then -1.
* diagnosis status: whether or not the person has been diagnosed.
  * 0: undiagnosed
  * 1: diagnosed
* init_art_lag: the time lag between being diagnosed and going on ART. If never on ART, then -1. If diagnosis status is 1, and this is -999999 then the person is in the never going on ART.

  * 0: Never
  * 1: Always (almost)
  * 2: Partial Plus
  * 3: Partial Minus
* art_adherence_category: the person's adherence category.
  * 0: Never
  * 1: Always (almost)
  * 2: Partial Plus
  * 3: Partial Minus
  * 4: None of the above. Person is either not infected, or not yet diagnosed, and so ART adherence doesn't apply.
* adhered_interval_count: the number of intervals during which a partially adherent person is on ART.
* non_adhered_interval_count: the number of intervals during which a partially adherent person is not on ART.
* infection_source: the "source" of the infection
  * 0 via internal edge transmission
  * 1 via the external infection mechanism
  * 2 N/A person is not infected
* time_of_diagnosis: the time at which an individual is diagnosed or -1 if never diagnosed.

### PrEP Intervention Logging

The intervention logging is defined in 3 properties:  *default.prep.log.file*, *serodiscordant.prep.log.file*, *network.prep.log.file*, and *random.selection.prep.log.file*. When
these are defined in the properties, the detailed logging for that intervention type will be activated. When running serodiscordant or
network interventions, the *base* part of the intervention will be recorded in the *default.prep.log.file* and the intervention in appropriate
file.

For the *default*, *random.selection.prep.log.file*, and *serodiscordant*, the following will be recorded.

* tick: the time at which the data was recorded
* count: the number of possible candidates for the intevention (e.g  persons not on PrEP and in serodiscordant relationship). 
* selected: the number of persons from the candidate pool selected to go on PrEP
* off_prep_adjustment: the amount added to the stop term in the probability calculation in order to account for persons going off prep due to exiting the model etc.
* probability: the probability used to select persons to go on PrEP

Each iteration will record two rows of the above data, one for the *lt* case and one for the *gte* case.

For the *network* intervention, the following will be recorded.

* tick: the time at which the data was recorded
* count: the number of possible candidates for the intevention (e.g  persons not on PrEP and in serodiscordant relationship). 
* top_n_count: the top_n * count number of persons to select
* selected: the number of persons from the candidate pool selected to go on PrEP
* off_prep_adjustment: the amount added to the stop term in the probability calculation in order to account for persons going off prep due to exiting the model etc.
* probability: the probability used to select persons to go on PrEP
