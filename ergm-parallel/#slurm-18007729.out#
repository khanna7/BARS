NOTE: If you use custom ERGM terms based on ‘ergm.userterms’ version
prior to 3.1, you will need to perform a one-time update of the package
boilerplate files (the files that you did not write or modify) from
‘ergm.userterms’ 3.1 or later. See help('eut-upgrade') for
instructions.

Starting maximum likelihood estimation via MCMLE:
Iteration 1 of at most 20: 
The log-likelihood improved by 0.001306 
Step length converged once. Increasing MCMC sample size.
Iteration 2 of at most 20: 
The log-likelihood improved by 0.005724 
Step length converged twice. Stopping.

This model was fit using MCMC.  To examine model diagnostics and check for degeneracy, use the mcmc.diagnostics() function.
