NOTE: If you use custom ERGM terms based on ‘ergm.userterms’ version
prior to 3.1, you will need to perform a one-time update of the package
boilerplate files (the files that you did not write or modify) from
‘ergm.userterms’ 3.1 or later. See help('eut-upgrade') for
instructions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
An MPI process has executed an operation involving a call to the
"fork()" system call to create a child process.  Open MPI is currently
operating in a condition that could result in memory corruption or
other system errors; your MPI job may hang, crash, or produce silent
data corruption.  The use of fork() (or system() or other calls that
create child processes) is strongly discouraged.  

The process that invoked fork was:

  Local host:          midway437 (PID 7281)
  MPI_COMM_WORLD rank: 0

If you are *absolutely sure* that your application will successfully
and correctly survive a call to fork(), you may disable this warning
by setting the mpi_warn_on_fork MCA parameter to 0.
