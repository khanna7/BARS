# ART and PrEP scale-up for MSM in Chicago: Triangulating results from three methods

## Overview
  - Methods include the time series techniques (Loess, Bonacic and Holtgrave), and comparable scenarios reproduced with our ABNM.
  - Published in _Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering_ (see [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34198418/))

## Data Production and Analysis for Time Series Methods
  - Code available in the CCHE group [GitHub repository](https://github.com/UChicago-CCHE-Modeling/projections/blob/main/time-series-analysis.R)
 
 ## Data Production (ABNM)
  - Executable version v0.57.
  - UPF ([here](https://github.com/khanna7/BARS/blob/MBE-paper/transmission_model/swift_proj/data/ART_PrEP_both_40.R))
