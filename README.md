## Stimulant Use Interventions may increase for YBMSM
Code for published _IJDP_ [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395922000482)

## Data Generation
 - Can be done using executable v0.72
 - For calibration, use substance-use-calibration branch

## Unrolled Parameter Files (UPFs) for Data Generation
 - R files to generate the UPFs for the calibration and each of the interventions are [here](https://github.com/khanna7/BARS/tree/substance-use-paper/transmission_model/swift_proj/data).
 - The code produces output in txt format that is read by swift, and in csv format for easy readability. 

## Data Analysis 
 - Code to produce annualized HIV incidence and prevalence for the calibration and intervention runs is [here](https://github.com/khanna7/BARS/tree/substance-use-paper/transmission_model/swift_proj/experiments/12sc).
