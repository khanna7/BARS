# BARS
code for collaboration on CJI project
## Jail Circulation Model
Code for unpublished _JCM_ [paper](https://uchicago.box.com/s/2jqy4gv3khohqxgrjqllrd9c4eyg5pso)

## Data Generation
 - Can be done using executable v0.72

## Unrolled Parameter Files (UPFs) for Data Generation
 - R file to generate all the needed UPFs for the calibration and the interventions are [here](https://github.com/khanna7/BARS/tree/jcm-paper/transmission_model/swift_proj/data).
 - The code produces output in txt format that is read by swift, and in csv format for easy readability. 

## Data Analysis 
 - Code to produce annualized HIV incidence and prevalence for the calibration and intervention runs as well as the final incidence and prevalence boxplots is [here](https://github.com/khanna7/BARS/tree/jcm-paper/transmission_model/swift_proj/R). 
 - Follow the instructions in the readme to reproduce the various plots.
 - Instructions on how to generate the plots are [here](https://github.com/khanna7/BARS/blob/jcm-paper/transmission_model/swift_proj/R/README.md).
