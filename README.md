# BARS
Code for published _AIDS_ [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31490212/)

## Data Production
 - Can be done either using executable v0.54 or v0.57.
 - [Changelog](https://github.com/khanna7/BARS/blob/scheduled_intervention/transmission_model/changelog.txt) says "No version 0.57 due to versioning confusion" but Bryan, Francus used it to reproduce the results. 
 - This branch is off of commit for v0.57.
