# BARS
Code for published _AIDS_ [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31490212/)

## Data Generation
 - Can be done either using executable v0.54 or v0.57.
 - [Changelog](https://github.com/khanna7/BARS/blob/scheduled_intervention/transmission_model/changelog.txt) says "No version 0.57 due to versioning confusion" but Bryan, Francis used it to reproduce the results. 
 - This branch is off of commit for v0.57.

## Unrolled Parameter Files (UPFs) for Data Generation
 - R files to generate the UPFs for the calibration and each of the interventions are [here](https://github.com/khanna7/BARS/tree/AIDS-GTZ-paper/transmission_model/swift_proj/data).
 - The code produces output in txt format that is read by swift, and in csv format for easy readability.
